Richard needed to calibrate his photoresistor with a 330ohm resistor to get readings that would work for this room 


Processing:
We want to use this UDP library: https://ubaa.net/shared/processing/udp/
Installing library via Processing IDE would not work, had to manually download zip and move to correct folder

Wireless Communication Issues:
Darwin wasnâ€™t receiving data because of firewall issues (Linux)
Needed to open a UDP port in firewall to allow the packets through to laptop 
Richard needed to put laptop ip address + the port in the arduino code (loop portion) but his firewall settings were fine (Mac)

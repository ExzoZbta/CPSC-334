Overview
--------
'Onmetaphobia' is esp32-Processing-powered installation art relying on user interaction with a photoresistor and touch sensors within an eyeball.

  Specs of 'Onmetaphobia' project
  ------------------------------
  - Files included:
    - module3-sensor.ino
      - Allows the esp32 to connect to 'yale wireless' wifi automatically
      - Sends the sensor data to whatever device the esp32 is connected to (laptop/RPI)
    - eyes-processing (folder)
      - onmetaphobia.pde
        - Takes in the sensor data from module3-sensor
        - Displays the eyes and the output of the user interaction with the sensors onto the device's screen

  - Sensors included:
    - a photoresistor (coming out of the pupil of the enclosure)
    - 4 touch sensors (out of the left, right, top, bottom of the enclosure)
   
  Description of 'Onmetaphobia' project
  --------------------------------------
  - Upon running, you are greeted with an eye in the center of the screen.
    - The eye is randomly looking around. It might look up at you, straight at you, or beside you. The independent pupil movement is               simulated using Perlin noise.
  - There is a **photoresistor** coming out of the pupil of the enclosure.
    - The more light it senses, the more the pupil of the eye on the screen shrinks (max value: 4095)
    - The less light it senses, the more the pupil of the eye dilates (min value: 0)

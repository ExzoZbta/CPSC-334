Overview
--------
blobs is a p5.js sketch that creates two animated blobs (referred to as "blob1" and "blob2") on a canvas. Each blob is made up of multiple nodes that move around, leaving a trail behind. 

  Description of blobs
  --------------------
  - The blobs are composed of multiple nodes connected by curves, and these nodes move based on sinusoidal functions, angles, and frequencies.
  - "blob1" and "blob2" spawn randomly on the canvas, move in different directions, and (can) move at different speeds. 
  - the blobs' colors are generated randomly
  - they will pass through each other


Usage
-----
- A new image will be created after every loading of the program.
- Every time you resize the window in which the program is loaded, the lines generated by the blobs will begin anew——providing a fresh canvas for the blobs to glide upon.
